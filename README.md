## 🔍 What Looked Suspicious?
Here are the warning signs I noticed:
| 🚩 Indicator | 💬 Why It’s Suspicious |
|-------------|------------------------|
| *Strange Sender Email* | The domain webnotifications.me isn’t linked to any known hospital – looks spoofed. |
| *Urgent Tone* | Phrases like “Urgent” try to rush the user into clicking without thinking. |
| *Fake Link Buttons* | Hovering over the button shows a different link from what’s written – classic phishing move. |
| *No Official Branding* | No logos, no organization name, and no formal signature. |
| *Generic Message* | Doesn’t reference the user’s real name or organization. |
| *Awkward Wording* | Some grammar and sentence structures are slightly off. |
| *Social Engineering* | Uses the healthcare theme to build false trust and urgency. |
